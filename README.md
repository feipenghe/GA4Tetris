# GA4Tetris


Genetic Algorithm for playing tetris in Python. 

Reproduced from this [blog](https://codemyroad.wordpress.com/2013/04/14/tetris-ai-the-near-perfect-player/). The blogger wrote his algorithm in Javascript.

This project didn't achieve as good results as it claimed. I think it's probably due to the environment difference(this environment doesn't have access to next piece).
